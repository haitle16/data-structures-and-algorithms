# Stack and Queues
<!-- Short summary or background information -->

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
* Implementation of Stack and Queues data structures.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
* Stacks
    * Time: O(1)
    * Space: O(n)
* Queues
    * Time: O(n)
    * Space O(n)
* PseudoQueue
    * Time: O(1)
    * Space O(n)

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Linked List -->
* Push method adds a new node to the top of the stack data structure.
* Enqueue method adds a new node to the front of the queue data structure.
* Peek method returns value of top / front node.
* isEmpty method return a boolean is the data structure is empty.
* Pop method removes a node from the top of the stack.
* Dequeue method remove a node from the front of the queue.
