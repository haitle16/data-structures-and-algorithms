### Challenges
* Reverse an array
    * Write a method called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument, return an array with elements in reversed order.
* Insert and shift an array
    * Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and the value to be added, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.
* Binary search in a sorted 1 dimension array
    * Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key, return the index of the array’s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist
* Define a method called insert which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
* Define a method called includes which takes any value as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Node’s value somewhere within the list.
* Define a method called toString which takes in no arguments and returns a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
  "{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"
* Define a method called mergeLists which take two Linked Lists as arguments, zip the two linked lists together into one so that the nodes alternate between the two lists and return a reference to the head of the zipped list.
